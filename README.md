## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Cleave.js

### What I learned

This was a great challenge for practicing form validation. Slightly more difficult than the ones I did before. My biggest take away from this challenge was learning to make the script a bit more modular especially for error handling. Even though the input fields were not that many, I intentionally try to come up with modular solution that can easily be scaled. Also I had to use cleave.js to format the mortgage amount input field.

### Continued development

There is no better way to learn than to keep practicing on actual projects. Every challenge makes me feel more confident once completed.
